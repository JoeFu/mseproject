Questions
1. Confirm the content of the questionnaire (see attachment).
2. Can you provide us with a list of lecturers that
	we should send our questionnaire to?
3. The form of questionnaire: let them
	send questions by replying email or write down 
	questions on a web page?
4. After a lecturer logins in, we provide a drop down
	box at the top of the page. The lecturer can choose 
	the courses he teach, then all the charts will be
	updated to the course he chooses. Is this ok?
5. If the course chosen is in 2012 semester 2, then the period
	for each chart should be from July to November
	in 2012?
6. Do you need charts for a certain course across several years?
7. The period of the threshold (auto-complete) in event name.
8. Shall we apply the same to "event context"?
9. In what form do you expect us to answer critical questions?
	Chart and text?
